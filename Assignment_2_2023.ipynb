    "- **LO8** - Explain key security concepts and the use of cryptographic techniques, digital signatures and PKI in security\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to submit the following items:\n",
    "- The notebook `Assignment_2_2023_uXXXXXXX.ipynb` (where uXXXXXXX is your uid) [Please note that if you have to pull from the upstream repo you will need to change the name back first and add your uid after the pull again]\n",
    "- A completed `statement-of-originality.md`, found in the root of the forked gitlab repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Submissions are performed by pushing to your forked GitLab assignment repository. For a refresher on forking and cloning repositories, please refer to `Lab 1`. Issues with your Git repo (with the exception of a CECS/ANU wide Gitlab failure) will not be considered as grounds for an extension. Any violation of this will result in a `zero mark`.\n",

    "### Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is strongly advised to read the whole assignment before attempting it and have at least a cursory glance at the dataset in order to gauge the requirements and understand what you need to do as a bigger picture.\n",
    "* Backup your assignment to your Gitlab repo often. \n",
    "* Extra reading and research will be required. Make sure you include all references in your Statement of Originality. If this does not occur, at best marks will be deduced. Otherwise, academic misconduct processes will be followed.\n",
    "* For answers requiring free form written text, use the designated cells denoted by `YOUR WRITTEN ANSWER HERE` -- double click on the cell to write inside them. You can change these to Markdown cells where necessary (e.g. you may need to include some figures in your answer).\n",
    "* For all coding questions please write your code after the comment `YOUR CODE HERE`.\n",
    "* In the process of testing your code, you can insert more cells or use print statements for debugging, but when submitting your file remember to remove these cells and calls respectively. You are welcome to add additional cells to the final submission, provided they add value to the overall piece.\n",
    "* Your code answers will be marked on **correctness** and **readability** of your code, if your marker can't understand your code your marks may be deducted. \n",
    "* Your written answers will be marked on the **correctness**, **depth** and **clarity** of your written answers. If your marker cannot understand your answer, marks may be deducted\n",
    "* Before submitting, restart the kernel in Jupiter Lab and re-run all cells before submitting your code. This will ensure the namespace has not kept any old variables, as these won't come across in submission and your code will not run. Without this, you could lose a significant number of marks.\n",

    "\n",
    "* A professional plot typically has the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Clear and concise labeling: A professional plot should have clear and concise labeling of the x and y axes, as well as a clear title that conveys the purpose of the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Appropriate scales: The scales on the x and y axes should be appropriate for the data being presented. This means that the scales should be chosen so that the data is not too compressed or stretched out, and so that important features of the data are easily visible.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Appropriate plot type: The plot type should be appropriate for the data being presented. For example, if the data is continuous, a line plot or a scatter plot may be appropriate. If the data is categorical, a bar chart or a pie chart may be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Clarity: A professional plot should be visually clear and easy to interpret. This means that unnecessary elements should be removed, colors should be used judiciously, and the plot should be free of clutter.\n",

    "    * Consistency: A professional plot should be consistent in its formatting with other plots that may be presented in the same report. This means that font sizes, line widths, and colors should be consistent across all plots."

    "Consider the following scenario:\n",
    "> You've been successful in your application as a database developer for an unnamed wrestling company. Your managers wish to understand why it is so difficult to search through the results of past events, and to your surprise you find all the results as csv files on your computer. The previous database developer never bothered to make a database, and manually kept track of all the information of the events - making it very difficult for quick searches. You've been tasked with building a database for the company to use to fix this. Rather than starting from scratch, you're hoping you can use the event results to start filling in information. The first folder you find is called rumble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is as follows:\n",
    "  - Draw a simple ER diagram showing the relationships specified below.\n",
    "  - Evaluate your design with respect to normalisation considerations.\n",
    "  - Implement your design in an SQLite database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is the requirements brief that was provided to you by your manager in an email:\n",
    ">Afternoon newbie,\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Our company runs a really special match called the Royal Rumble, but so far we haven't been keeping digital records of it very well. We've been running it for a while, so a lot of it is paper-based, but the previous database developer had stored it all in text files which you should have access to.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">So basically, the company is built on events, which we run once a year. An event would normally have a title, year, location, and attendance, although we may have to enter some of that information by ourselves later.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Each event has a series of matches. Initially we only ran one match at each event, but lately we've been doing one for male and one for female. A match has a title, list of participants, how long each respective participant was in the match and how many people they eliminated, one winner, and how long the match went for. Some other organisations rate their matches, although I don't like that so don't worry about that aspect.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Finally, the wrestlers, or participants, will all have a stage name, real name and gender. A lot of this information we will have to enter later, but at least we can enter in the information we have. You can just assume the records contain the stage name, not the real name.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Don't worry about formatting issues; for example, if a wrestler's name is \"Mankind\" one event, then \"Cactus Jack\" another year, and \"Dude Love\" the year after, you can just pretend they're different wrestlers. People change their names all the time. Similarly, if the previous database designer entered a wrestler as \"D'Lo Brown\" in one place and \"DLo Brown\" in another place, you can also pretend that's two wrestlers. We'll fix that up manually later.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Good luck!\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the data is unlikely in an ideal format, so you will need to explore and understand the data yourself before getting started. See the Rumble about.md for additional details (in a real-world situation, even this information would not be provided). We will only be able to clarify any errors or unreasonably ambiguous details. Remember to state all assumptions beforehand."
